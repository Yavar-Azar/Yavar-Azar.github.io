# 👋 Hi, I'm Yavar Azar

I'm a **researcher**, **scientific software developer**, and a growing enthusiast in **cloud-based technologies**. My background blends **computational materials science**, **quantum chemistry**, and **modern web development**, with a strong passion for turning complex scientific workflows into intuitive applications.

---

## 🔬 Computational Materials Science

My core expertise lies in **computational modeling and simulations** of energy-related materials. I’ve spent years working with **quantum chemistry** and **density functional theory (DFT)** tools to understand and predict material properties at the atomic scale.

I'm familiar with a wide range of quantum codes and platforms, including:

- **Quantum Chemistry Packages**: `Gaussian`, `NWChem`, `PySCF`, `GAMESS`
- **DFT Packages**: `Quantum ESPRESSO`, `SIESTA`, `DFTB+`

---

## 💻 Scientific Software & Web Application Development

In parallel with research, I’ve been actively developing **scientific web applications** to streamline simulation workflows, automate preprocessing/postprocessing, and enhance usability for computational researchers.

Some of my development interests and experience include:

- Building web UIs and APIs for platforms like **SIESTA**
- Using **Django** and **TypeScript** to bridge scientific computing and user-friendly interfaces
- Creating custom scripts and tools to analyze quantum chemistry outputs

---

## ☁️ Cloud Enthusiast (AWS & SaaS)

Recently, I’ve been exploring the power of **cloud computing**—especially on **AWS**—to scale scientific software and build **SaaS platforms** that make complex simulations accessible to more users.

I’m interested in:
- **Deploying scientific tools to the cloud**
- **Automating pipelines** using AWS Lambda, S3, and ECS
- Developing scalable services using modern dev tools

---

## 🤝 Open to Collaboration & Consulting

I'm always happy to:
- **Collaborate** on interdisciplinary research or software development
- **Consult** in areas including:
  - Computational material science & quantum chemistry
  - Python & TypeScript application development
  - Cloud-based deployment of scientific tools

If you’re working on something exciting or need support with your scientific software, feel free to reach out!
